 ![Hello Rust Show logo](hello-rust.png)

This is the main repository of *Hello Rust*,  
a live-coding show by [Matthias Endler](@mre) about the Rust programming language.  
It is targeted towards intermediate Rust programmers, who have already read [the book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) and want to learn advanced patterns and tricks as well as how to write ergonomic code in Rust.

In this repository, you find the list of previous episodes, the planned shows and the show notes.

### Creating an episode

The following notes are helpful for me when recording a new episode.  
Also, I thought it might be interesting to others, who also consider to run their own show.  

#### Getting started

* Pick an issue from the [issues page](https://github.com/hello-rust/show/issues) or create a new one.
* Prefix the issue title with the next show number.

#### Shooting the video

* Cleanup SD card of digital camera
* Prepare lighting
* Set-up microphone
* Test recording and audio
* Close all unrelated apps
* Hide Bookmarks Toolbar in Firefox (right-click next to address bar and remove tick)
* Prepare IDE settings
  - Set slightly bigger font (VS Code: `editor.fontSize": 15`)
  - ~~Enter "zen mode"~~ (doesn't show the terminal)
* Set Mac to *do not disturb mode*
* Get cracking!

### Shooting the intro

* Create a teaser intro that shows exactly what to expect as an outcome (show some code, too).

### Postproduction

1. Cut video
2. Normalize sound
3. Add music
4. Color Grading

#### Before publication

* Create nice title images for the video and the website.

#### Publication

1. [Github](https://github.com/hello-rust/show) (Show notes, plus link in `README`)
2. [Homepage](https://hello-rust.show)
3. [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/hellorust)
4. [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ_EWaQZCZuGGfnuqUoHujw)
5. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/hellorustshow)
6. [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/)

#### After publication

* Add show notes to the video description.
* Optional: Add time markers to the video description.
* ~~Charge camera battery for next shoot.~~ (I bought an external power adapter)

### FAQ

**Q: What development environment do you use?**    
**A:** Right now, I use *VSCode* and the *Rust* plugin plus the *Rust Language Server*.  
I've heard good things about the IntelliJ Rust plugin, though.  
Therefore, I might try this setup in the future.  

**Q: What audio/video equipment do you use?**
**A:** Video: Canon 700D. Audio: Rhode NT USB, Takstar SGC 598.

**Q: What is your post-processing routine?**    
**A:** Quite simple. I solely use ~~iMovie~~ (Davinci Resolve) right now. There are better programs out there, but so far it does the job. I'm mostly annoyed by the long rendering times on my MacBook. (5 hours for 30 minutes of video)

**Q: What is the name of your color theme?**  
**A:** Usually I use 1337, but that can vary per show. I will try to mention it in the show notes, if it's something else.

**Q: What font are you using?**  
**A:** Operator Sans Mono
