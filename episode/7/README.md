# Episode 7 - Parsing Dates Using Proptest And Tdd

Testing is hard, as can be seen in the last two episodes. That's why I looked around for better alternatives and found proptest.  
Let's take a look at proptest, a library for automatically generating testcases similar to quickcheck (of Haskell fame). We will parse informal english dates like "4th of September 1927" using Proptest and TDD.
