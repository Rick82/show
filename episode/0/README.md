# Episode 0 - Humble Beginnings

This is the very first episode of "Hello Rust!". I'm so excited!
  
It is my lighthearted journey to become a fearless, more effective Rust programmer. And you can be part, too! My goal is to address beginner and intermediate Rust questions and show that systems programming can be a lot of fun.
