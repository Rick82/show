title: Coding Challenge - Balanced Brackets
url: https://youtu.be/XcuLHO8z_RA
intro: >
      Today we will do a quick interview question called "balanced brackets"
details: >
      I maintain a list of common interview questions on Github, that is perfect for some quick fun exercise from time to time.
      In this case I'd like to introduce you to a task called "balanced brackets", which is some sort of state machine,
      to check if an input consisting of brackets has exactly one closing bracket for each opening bracket.
