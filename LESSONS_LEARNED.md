### Consistency

- Doing a single episode takes me *ages*. I would never have thought it takes so
  much time. The time is distributed between topic preparation (2-3 hours),
  audio/video setup (30min-1h), recording (1h-2h), writing show notes (30min),
  post-processing (10-20h), publication (1h).

- It's pretty easy to find excuses for skipping an episode: live gets in the
  way, there's more important stuff to do, the content doesn't feel right yet,
  there was a technical problem while recording,... don't fall into that trap. I
  try to avoid skipping the schedule at all costs. Consistency is king and
  viewers reward it. I treat "Hello Rust!" like a TV show: Even if I know that
  no episode will ever be perfect, I still publish at the scheduled time (which
  can be pretty intimidating).

### Resources

- There's a ton of royality free music out there, but it's hard to find because
  it's not properly categorized or the preview is cumbersome. Right now I use
  [freemusicarchive](freemusicarchive.org/), although it's not the most
  convenient to use.

### Lessons learned the hard way

- Always double check the final rendered video for hick-ups before uploading.
- Video assets are huuuge. A typical episode takes hundreds of gigabytes of
  render files. To edit efficiently, I have to squeeze out every byte from my
  tiny disk. In the long run, I will have to invest in better hardware, which I
  haven't done in a while because Computers are reasonably fast for most task
  today - not so for recording.
- After a video is shot, you can not change the narrative anymore. You'll wake
  up in the morning and think: "oh my God, I totally forgot THAT". But the only
  you can do is add a comment or cut stuff, not add things to the recording.
  Therefore, a script is vital. I keep track of the things I absolutely have to
  say during the episode, but no word-by-word instructions.

### About finding your voice

- Bootstrapping a YouTube channel reminds me a lot of bootstrapping a band: you
  learn as you go and your first shows are most likely awful. This soul-seeking
  takes a while until you find your "voice" and your audience. 
- It's tempting to arrange the show like your viewers presumably want it to be,
  but it's very important that you stay true to yourself. If you want to revamp
  the show, just do it. Not everybody will like it, but it's your personal
  project and your freetime after all.
- In the beginning, it was hard to let my personality show through. I'm usually
  a very enthusiastic person, especially when it talking about programming, but
  in the videos it sometimes looked dull. Some people even commented that it was
  "painful to watch". It took me a while to figure out what was the reason. What
  helped me was looking at other people to learn their tricks on how to loosen
  things up.

  * [Peter McKinnon](https://www.youtube.com/user/petermckinnon24) is a
    charismatic storyteller. That's the level of enthusiasm I'd like to show.
    He's using a ton of b-roll to support his narrative.
  * The background music in [Hot
    Ones](https://www.youtube.com/user/FirstWeFeast) is top-notch. It really
    creates a thick atmosphere.
  * The audio and video set-up of Masterclass is second to none. Just watch a
    trailer of [Chris Hadfield's masterclass on space
    exploration](https://www.masterclass.com/classes/chris-hadfield-teaches-space-exploration)
    to get a glimpse of that.

  I realize that not many programming channels think so much about delivery, but
  that's one of the core parts of how I convey knowledge. My main goal is to
  inspire and entertain people.


  What I learned from them is that  music is pretty important (pizzicanto works
  good for my clumsy style), b-roll is quite cool (e.g. showing the website of a
  project while I talk about it), camera movements and zooms also work well.
  Sometimes I wish I had a dedicated camera-person to make that part easier. In
  the long run, I guess I'll have a second camera to record my hands and
  keyboard.

### Technique

- Like everything else, video editing is a rabbit hole. From multicamera setups
  to LUTs, there's sooo much to learn and experiment with. But it's also a lot
  of fun! It's important, that the main focus is always on the content, though.
- [Lighting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZ5hpcn6tIM) is also a rabbit hole
  and so is audio.

### Gear

- Invest in good gear. If you're serious about this, you will spend a LOT of
  time in front of the screen editing text / cutting videos. It's wise to spend
  some money on a good screen, mouse, keyboard and so on. Unfortunately, this
  ends in a never-ending race to find the perfect gear. And it can get quite
  expensive.
- Rendering is still a time-sink in 2018. Plan in some time for that. I usually
  try to render the master video over night.
