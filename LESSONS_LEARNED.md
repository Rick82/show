- Doing a single episode takes me *ages*. I would never have thought it takes so
  much time.
- After a video is shot, you can not change the narrative anymore. You'll wake
  up in the morning and think: "oh my God, I totally forgot THAT". But the only
  you can do is add a comment or cut stuff, not add things to the recording.
- There's a ton of royality free music out there, but it's hard to find because
  it's not properly categorized or the preview is cumbersome. Right now I use
  [freemusicarchive](freemusicarchive.org/), although it's not the most
  convenient to use.
- Like everything else, video editing is a rabbit hole. From multicamera setups
  to LUTs, there's sooo much to learn and experiment with. But it's also a lot
  of fun!
- Always double check the final rendered video for hick-ups before uploading.
- Video assets are huuuge. A typical episode takes hundreds of gigabytes of
  render files. To edit efficiently, I have to squeeze out every byte from my
  disk.
- It's tempting to arrange the show like your viewers presumably want it to be,
  but it's very important that you stay true to yourself. If you want to revamp
  the show, just do it. Not everybody will like it, but it's your baby after
  all.
- Invest in good gear. If you're serious about this, you will spend a LOT of
  time in front of the screen editing text / cutting videos. It's wise to spend
  some money on a good screen, mouse, keyboard and so on. Unfortunately, this
  ends in a never-ending race to find the perfect gear. And it can get quite
  expensive.
- Rendering is still a time-sink in 2018. Plan in some time for that. I usually
  try to render the final video over night.
- Bootstrapping a YouTube channel reminds me a lot of bootstrapping a band: you
  learn as you go and your first gigs are probably awful. This soul-seeking
  takes a while until you find your "voice" and your audience.
